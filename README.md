# Guitar Song Tuning API

As a guitarist who loves genres that utilize different guitar tunings,
I needed a project that I could relate to. Here it is.

# Synopsis
Guitarists like me love to obsess over things that are cool, but don't necessarily
matter all that much. One of those things is guitar tunings. 99% of guitar music 
is written in E-Standard, where the string are tuned to the notes: EADGBE, with each
letter representing one string. Metal, rock and a few other genres have a tendency
to stray away from standard tuning. 

**If I'm a guitarist who likes a song, but doesn't know what tuning it's, where can I go?**

Well you can definitely go to a tabs website, but I want to make a project lol

Come to my site! Use this API!
